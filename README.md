# Optimal Jets
This project is a reverse engineering of a jet "decoder" ring from the 1970s. Effectively a series of concentric rings allow users to identify what size carb jet is optimal for changing environmental conditions.

## Reverse Engineering
The `experiments` folder contains well documented notebook that demonstrates the reverse engineering process and portability to Android App.
